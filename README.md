# Protected Face

Project to create an automated proctoring system where the user can be monitored automatically through the webcam and microphone.

### Prerequisites
To run the programs in this repo, do the following:
- create a virtual environment using the command:
  - `python -m venv venv`
- activate the virtual environment
  - `cd ./venv/Scripts/activate` (windows users)
  - `source ./venv/bin/activate` (mac and linux users)
- install the requirements
  - `pip install --upgrade pip` (to upgrade pip)
  - `pip install -r requirements.txt`

Once the requirements have been installed, The programs will run successfully.
Except for the `person_and_phone.py` script which requires a model to be downloaded.

More on that later.


For vision:
```
Tensorflow>2
OpenCV
sklearn=0.19.1 # for face spoofing. 
The model used was trained with this version and does not support recent ones.
```
For audio:
```
pyaudio
speech_recognition
nltk
```

## Vision

It has six vision based functionalities right now:
1. Track eyeballs and report if candidate is looking left, right or up.
2. Find if the candidate opens his mouth by recording the distance between lips at starting.
3. Instance segmentation to count number of people and report if no one or more than one person detected.
4. Find and report any instances of mobile phones.
5. Head pose estimation to find where the person is looking.
6. Face spoofing detection
